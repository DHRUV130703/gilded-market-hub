## 🔗 Frontend Integration

The backend is designed to work seamlessly with your React frontend. You can replace the hardcoded data in your frontend components with API calls:

```javascript
// Replace hardcoded featured products
const response = await fetch('http://localhost:3001/api/products/featured');
const { data: featuredProducts } = await response.json();

// Replace hardcoded categories
const response = await fetch('http://localhost:3001/api/categories/main');
const { data: categories } = await response.json();

// Replace hardcoded brands
const response = await fetch('http://localhost:3001/api/brands/featured');
const { data: brands } = await response.json();
```
